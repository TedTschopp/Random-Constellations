# Random-Constellations
Code to generate a random Constellation's star

## TODO
Distribute Stars names
* 300 - 350 stars are named for historical reasons (The brightest)
* 25 stars named for people
* 1600 cataloged stars (the top 1500) use Bayer whcih is Latin posessive form *is,i or ae um (if the name is plural) This is almostwhat I have here.  Need to congigate the latin

The above can be used for most stars unless setting is Sci-Fi.  Then catalogue numbers are needed
